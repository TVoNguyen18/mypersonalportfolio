      <h3>A little about me</h3>
      <p>My name is Thanhthanh, and I am a 9th grader. I like to read and code,
      and I am currently trying to find ideas for the next Great American novel. If
      I'm not reading, coding, or daydreaming, you can likely find me taking a nap.</p>

      <h3>What I think about coding</h3>
      <p>I think that the future lies in the hands of the tech industry. As technology
      evolves, our machines take over our jobs. As long as robots are not smart
      enough to evade our grasp, we can control them using code. That is why I believe
      that schools should make room in their curriculum to teach students coding.</p>

      <h3>What I love about reading</h3>
      <p>When I've gone through an exhausting day, I like to curl up and read.
      Reading is a real stress reliever. You can lose yourself in the world of your
      book and forgot that your mom had told you to fold the laundry. Sorry, Mom.</p>
